# This config file holds settings for modules.
# Settings set here are available within its respective modules.
# In a general sense, this config works the same way as
# sophia.conf.example. So please read through that for more information
# if you haven't already read through it.
# 
# Format:
# module:
#   setting1: value1
#   setting2: value2
#
# wildcards can also be used
# module/*:
#   setting1: value1
#
# so example, if you are using the Google modules that
# require an API Key, you would add an api_key value
#
# google/dictionary:
#   api_key: 'key'
#
# You can also use:
# google/*:
#   api_key: 'key'
#
# to specify a key to use for all modules within the google directory
# At the same time, if you specifed an api_key value within both
# google/dictionary and google/*, google/dictionary will override
# google/*'s api_key
#
# Note: using wildcards, you can define a * entry for global settings
# that will be accessible to all modules.
#
# You can enter WHATEVER settings you want; however, it's really
# only useful if the modules use them.
#
# We know that we cannot assume that you will know what settings are
# available. Therefore, any user-settable settings will be defined below.
# Its value may be empty and you may be required to set it if you wish
# to use those modules.
