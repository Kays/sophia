INSTALL / SETUP

Run "./configure" to make sure you have the required packages installed. If you do not have the required packages you can install them through CPAN.

PREP

You need to set a configuration file. Copy etc/sophia.conf.example to etc/sophia.conf. Once you copy this file open it up and change the necessary settings. Also if you want all the modules to load on your first start, copy etc/sophia.modules.conf.example to etc/sophia.modules.conf.

RUN

To launch sophia run "./bin/sophia"
